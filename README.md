Solana Trading Bot
Overview
This project is a Solana trading bot that automates the process of tracking exclusive token holders, monitoring their SOL balance, and executing buy and sell orders based on certain conditions. The bot performs the following tasks:

Picks a specific token.
Finds holders who have only that token as their balance.
Continuously refreshes the holders list (adding new holders and removing those who no longer meet the criteria).
Tracks each holder to detect if they add SOL to their wallet.
Buys the specified token if SOL is added to a holder's wallet and then immediately sells the token.
Sells the token after a certain period if the holder doesn't buy the token after adding SOL to their wallet.
Project Structure
index.ts: The main file that orchestrates the bot's operations.
monitor.ts: Contains the logic for monitoring token holders and their SOL balance.
types.ts: Defines the TypeScript types used throughout the project.
